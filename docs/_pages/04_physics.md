# What is energy?
Energy is the ability to do work

Since electrical energy is being transported to every household and can be converted to a force or heat so easily we focus on generating electrical energy.

# Properties of energy
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. But it can be transformed into different forms like kinetical or potential energy.

For thermal energy the laws of thermodynamic have to be watched.

# Forms of energy
The ability to do work results from forces.
Force: interaction between two objects. A force is a vector quantity: its has a magnitude and a direction.

The forces are: (https://www.clearias.com/four-fundamental-forces-of-nature/)
 The weak and strong forces are effective only over a very short range and dominate only at the level of subatomic particles. Gravity and Electromagnetic force have infinite range. 

- Gravity (gives potential energy)
- Electromagnetic force (gives chemical energy)
- Weak force
- Strong force
